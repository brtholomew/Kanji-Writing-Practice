# Kanji-Writing-Practice
will eventually become an Anki flashcard addon that will allow the user to practice balance and stroke order for kanji

originally i wanted the program to be directly embedded straight into anki itself however that requires html/javascript which i am NOT familar with yet so that's gonna have to wait for now
